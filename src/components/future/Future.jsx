          We aim to expand beyond educational credentials to support various
          industries, such as professional certifications, healthcare, and more.
          By partnering with global universities and certification bodies, we
          intend to broaden our user base. Our vision includes introducing a
          marketplace for verified credentials, allowing employers to validate
          qualifications easily and setting a new standard for trust and
          transparency in professional and academic verification worldwide.
